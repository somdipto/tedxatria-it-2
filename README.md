## TEDxAtria IT College - Bengaluru, India

This repository contains the source code for the TEDxAtria IT College website, specifically for the upcoming event on **Saturday, November 9th, 2024**.

### Getting Started

This website is built using a framework (likely Framer).  **Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is helpful for making minor edits.** 

**Prerequisites:**

* A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
* (Optional) Familiarity with Framer

**Steps:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Review the code structure:
    * `index.html`: The main page of the website.
    * `assets`: This folder likely contains images, logos, and other website assets.
    * `styles`: This folder likely contains CSS stylesheets for the website design.
    * `scripts`: This folder may contain JavaScript files for website interactivity (if any).
4. You can make edits directly to the HTML and CSS files to customize the website content. 

**Important Note:**

* Modifying the website code might require approval from the TEDxAtria IT College organizing team. 

### Content Management

The content for this website, such as speaker information, event schedule, and sponsor logos, might be managed through a separate Content Management System (CMS) provided by the website hosting platform.  **Refer to the website hosting platform documentation or contact the TEDxAtria IT College organizing team for information about content updates.**
